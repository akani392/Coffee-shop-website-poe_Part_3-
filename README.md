Coffee shop website that has the final changes and has added features such as a form, gallery light box and other java script changes

Part 2 Changes
This report outlines the updates, changes, and newly added features implemented in the Part version of the website. These enhancements were made to improve functionality, user experience, interactivity, and navigation across various web pages.

Footer Enhancements
A JavaScript-based date and time feature was added to the footer of every webpage. This ensures that users always see the current date and time, improving the website’s dynamic feel and user engagement.

 Locate.html Improvements
Previously, the Locate page displayed a random map with limited functionality. A dropdown box has now been added, allowing users to select a specific restaurant location. Depending on the user's selection, a relevant map appears. This change was made using JavaScript to dynamically change the displayed map and increase usability.

Menu.html Interactive Features
The Menu page now includes a filtering system for drinks and food. When the user clicks on the Drinks option, only drink items appear along with a dropdown list for selecting a specific drink category. Choosing an option displays drink items belonging to that category. Similarly, selecting the Food option shows only food-related items and a category dropdown. These dynamic features were developed using JavaScript.
 
Food and Drinks Category Selection Features
Within the individual food and drink item pages (e.g., Cookies, Frappe, Latte), JavaScript features were implemented to allow users to select customization options. Users can choose one option for categories such as size and flavor. However, toppings allow multiple selections, enabling users to customize their orders with more flexibility.

Taskbar Modifications
The taskbar was updated to include new website links and make navigation easier. The cafe's name (Caffe Latte) and the logo were updated so that clicking them now redirects users to the Home page. This replaced the older Home button functionality.

 Addition of Form.html (Sign-Up Form)
A new webpage, Form.html, was created as a sign‑up form for Caffe Latte’s membership program called Latte Club. The form collects the user’s name, surname, email address, birthday, and preferred method for receiving updates. Upon completion, the user is shown a summary of their input. If the user's birthday is within two days (before or after the current date), a birthday message is displayed.
This page contains several navigation buttons, including options to return to Club.html, redo the form, return to Home.html, or submit the details. The Submit feature uses EmailJS to send the membership details.
 
Logo Integration Across Webpages
A consistent restaurant logo has been added to the header of all main webpages. Additionally, food and drink pages include smaller icons representing the specific item category.

Meta Tags Added
Meta tags were added across the website to improve SEO, browser compatibility, and accessibility.

Locate.html Image Gallery Lightbox
At the bottom of Locate.html, a set of five images was added. When the user hovers over any image, it darkens slightly. Clicking on an image opens a larger version of it along with the specific store's location. The user can scroll right through the gallery to view other images and their corresponding information. This feature functions as a lightbox gallery.

The enhancements made to the website significantly improve navigation, visual interaction, and user experience. The use of JavaScript, updated UI elements, improved mapping features, and a new membership system contribute to a more modern, dynamic, and user‑friendly website.
